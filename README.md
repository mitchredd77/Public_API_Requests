This JavaScript program pulls twelve employees from an API then displays them on the screen, in a card style. If
an employee's card is clicked, a Modal is brought to the front with a more detailed view of the employee. The Modal
has a prev and next button to cycle through the employees in the Modal view. There's also a search box to narrow down
the by the name of the employee.

Style changed from original CSS:

The body background has been changed to a light yellow - #FFFACD
Added a left margin to the header - h1, to center it.
Also changed the header's color to black, and changed it's font size to 1.7.
The body font was changed to Tahoma.
Changed the border each card to red.
